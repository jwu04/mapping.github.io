# Song Setup

Don't worry if you haven't memorized them all yet, the more you map, it will become second nature to you to use these commands. Without further ado, let's import the .osz file that we've downloaded. It will automatically open in osu!, and the screen that you will see controls the metadata of the map. In other words, data to describe the beatmap is.

## General

On this screen, we see a few places to fill out.

### Artists

The creator of the song is put in 'artist,' and the anglicized version of them are put into 'romanised artist.'

### Title

Similarly, put the song's original title in 'title,' and the anglized version of it in 'romanised title.'

### Beatmap Creator

This should already be filled in with your osu username.

### Difficulty

The name of the difficulty should be appropriately named. As this guide will start with mapping a normal diff, let's name this one "Normal".

### Source

The source field should be where the song came from, or featured in some recognized media. As for this song, it was licensed for osu!, and you should put osu! in this field.

### Tags

This field contains all the other relevant keywords related to the map or song itself. We need to put the language and genre in our tags, so let's put 'japanese pop' into tags. Feel free to put any other identifying tags that people may search to find this song.

## Diff Setting

The next tab next to general is the difficulty tab. They control the overall difficulty (OD), approach rate (AR), hp drain rate (HP), and circle size (CS) of a beatmap. We will discuss the appropriate settings for each respective difficulty in the future modules.

## Audio

This part primarily concerns with hitsounding of a map, so leave the default sample settings for now. We will also want to lower the sample volume to anywhere from 50-60% to allow for fluctuations of the volume throughout the entire map.

## Colors

Most mappers use similar colors to a beatmap's background image chosen to better match the 'aesthetic' of a mapset. As we have not chosen a background image yet, we will come and revisit this later.

## Design

There is nothing of interest in this section, so there is no need to change anything unless you are creating a storyboard of a map or for other reasons not discussed in the scope of these modules.

## Advanced

Similarly, leave these settings be. They are options that are not discussed within the scope of these modules.

With that, most of the beatmap's settings have been established. Click 'ok'.
