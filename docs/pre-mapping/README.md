# The Editor
Hopefully by now, you understand the concepts from the previous module. It is impossible to thoroughly master each concept without actually mapping. After all, like how people say to 'play more' to get better at osu!, you need to 'map more' to learn how to better.

Every map is created in the editor, and it is imperative to leran a few improtant shortcuts that make your mapping life easier and faster. Here are a few that should be ingrained into your memory:
