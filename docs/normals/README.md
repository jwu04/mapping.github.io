# Mapping Normals

## Rules

There are a few established rules and guideslines for mapping Normals. Recall earlier the Ranking Criteria, and that the rules and guideslines on it are based on the assumption of the map being 180 beats per minute. Take some time to familarize with the rules and guidelines [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Ranking_criteria/osu%21#normal).

## Tips and Tricks

Once you have somewhat of an understanding on the rules and guidelines for mapping a normal difficulty, here are a few tips and tricks to aid you in the process of mapping one:

- Always use Distance Snap, and keep it at 1.0x
- Follow the K.I.S.S method: Keep It Simple, Stupid. There is no reason to make a normal difficulty complicated, the target audience is for people who don't even know how to play the game. 
- Keep the rhythm boring. Part of the K.I.S.S method is to also keep the rhythm boring, whether that means keeping the rhythm uninteresting or repetitive, the whole point of a normal difficulty is to allow for an intuitive rhythm for a new player to follow along to. For our song, it will be the singer's voice that takes priority. If there is a lack of vocals, then either don't map the sound there or map to the next strongest sound at that instance in time.
- Use straightforward sliders! New players won't be able to follow complex slider shapes well.
