# Requirements

Mapping has a few requirements, both physically and mentally. Here are some requirements that you will need:

- Having osu! client installed. If you somehow don't have the osu! client installed, you can [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home).
- Time. A lot of it. Mapping is a long process, and if you don't have a lot of time to spare, it may be harder to improve than you may realize.
- Patience. Improvement in mapping is gradual, and you may not notice your improvement at all. If you are frustrated with mapping, remind yourself to be patient with yourself.
- The ability to receive and accept criticism. The best way to improve is from asking others who already know how to map. In this regard, this feedback will be a great benefactor towards improvement, and try not to ignore these criticisms of your mapping as it will most likely help in the long run.
- Accept the fact that you will not be mapping anything stunning, amazing, or even playable if you're just starting out. Objects may look like a bunch of random circles and sliders thrown on the screen, and that's okay.
- Have a goal. You should always be working towards this goal, no matter how big or small it may be. It could be something as small as, *I want to make good maps*, or something as ambitious as, *I want to leave behind a legacy for people to osu! to enjoy* . So, in that case, answer the following, **Why do YOU map?**
- Enjoy mapping. Don't take mapping too seriously to the point where you aren't having fun doing it.

Once you have all of those. You're ready to begin your mapping journey.
