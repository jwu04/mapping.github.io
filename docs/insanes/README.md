# Mapping Insanes

## Rules

There are a few established rules and guideslines for mapping Hards. Recall earlier the Ranking Criteria, and that the rules and guideslines on it are based on the assumption of the map being 180 beats per minute. Take some time to familarize with the rules and guidelines [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Ranking_criteria/osu%21#insane).

## Tips and Tricks

Now we're onto insanes. If you can tell from the rules and guidelines, the maps become more freeform and allow for more creativity in your mapping. Now, you should be attempting to incorporate all of the key concepts introduced earlier into this map at your best ability. There aren't really many tips and tricks here as the rules are guidelines are few. Here are a few though:

- Recall how nicely spaced your objects were in your normals and hards, your objects rarely, if at all, overlapped which each other, and you should continue to strive for that for insane difficulties and up.
- Always keep in mind of the spread progression and don't make this difficulty to hard from the last one.
