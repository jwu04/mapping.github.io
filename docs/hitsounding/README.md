# Hitsounding

Now that we've mapped the required difficulties for this mapset, the last thing to do is to create hitsounds. Creating hitsounds are easier than people make them out to be, actually. Let's begin by equipping the default osu! skin.

Then, let's create a new difficulty and name it "Hitsounds". Now, there are many different ways to hitsound a map, but fundamentally, many people follow these guidelines for hitsounding:

- Whistles: primarily used for the main melody that your map is following
- Finishes: primarily used when there there is a cymbal crash is heard or a relatively loud downbeat
- Claps: primarily used for snares

For other sounds like kicks, we use either the drum-hitnormal sampleset located on the top left and use the addition of whichever sampleset we're using (in this case, clicking F6 will tell us N:C1, meaning we are using the normal sampleset), so click "Normal" for additions.

Just like that, your basic hitsounding toolkit is done! Finish hitsounding the rest of the map.
