# Mapping Hards

## Rules

There are a few established rules and guideslines for mapping Hards. Recall earlier the Ranking Criteria, and that the rules and guideslines on it are based on the assumption of the map being 180 beats per minute. Take some time to familarize with the rules and guidelines [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Ranking_criteria/osu%21#hard).

## Tips and Tricks

Mapping hards are similar to mapping normals, except it isn't. Here are a few tips and tricks to help you map hards:

- Always use Distance Snap. You can introduce variable Distance Snapping in your maps now!
- Keep in mind of having an appropriate spread from earlier. You don't want this difficulty to be too hard from the normal difficulty that you've just mapped.
- Start introducing some of the concepts like contrast, emphasis, rhythm, and concistency, but not too much as so the spread progression still makes sense.
- Start incorporating some variable Slider Velocities (but not too high or too low)!
