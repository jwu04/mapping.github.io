# Mapping Easies

## Rules

There are a few established rules and guideslines for mapping Easies. Recall earlier the Ranking Criteria, and that the rules and guideslines on it are based on the assumption of the map being 180 beats per minute. Take some time to familarize with the rules and guidelines [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Ranking_criteria/osu%21#easy).

## Tips and Tricks

Mapping easies is just like mapping normals, except even more strict. The good thing, however, is that if you do have an easy difficulty in your mapset, your normal difficulty is allowed to be "harder" in a sense because you have an easier difficulty for the newer players to play. That being said, here are the tips and tricks for mapping easy difficulties:

- Always use Distance Snap, and keep it at 1.0x.
- Keep the Slider Velocity at 1.0x as well.
- Follow the K.I.S.S method: Keep It Simple, Stupid. There is no reason to make a normal difficulty complicated, the target audience is for people who don't even know how to play the game.
- Keep the rhythm boring. Part of the K.I.S.S method is to also keep the rhythm boring, whether that means keeping the rhythm uninteresting or repetitive, the whole point of a normal difficulty is to allow for an intuitive rhythm for a new player to follow along to. For our song, it will be the singer's voice that takes priority. If there is a lack of vocals, then either don't map the sound there or map to the next strongest sound at that instance in time.
- Use straightforward sliders! New players won't be able to follow complex slider shapes well.
- Use an even sparse rhythm from the normal; use your normal difficulty as an inspiration to figure out which rhythms can be further simplified while remaining intuitive for newer players.
