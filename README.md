# The Mapping Manual

Welcome to The Mapping Manual. If you're reading this, it probably means that you want to learn how to map, or maybe you wanted a refresher on what some concepts in mapping are. Regardless if you're completely inexperienced to mapper or if you're a seasoned veteran at mapping, this is the right place to be. The all-in-one encompassing manual for your basic mapping needs.

Mapping is an evolutionary process and, for the most part, largely subjective; in fact, in a year, this manual may become dated and the concepts discussed in this manual will be redefined to the mapping of whichever year you're reading this from. It may even become dated in just a month!

If you still wish to follow along with this manual to learn how to map, this manual will use the song [tephe - Neppa feat. Butter](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/361) from the Featured Artists [library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) and is highly recommended for you to download it to follow along.

Why?

- Most [rules and guideslines](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Ranking_criteria/osu%21) for mapping are constructed under the assumption of a song being 180 beats per minute (BPM). The song *tephe - Neppa feat. Butter* is exactly 180BPM.
- The song is only one minute and 12 seconds long (1:12), so it is relatively short.
- The song itself is not complicated, so it is simpler to map and easier to communicate ideas presented in this manual.
- Your map (if uploaded) will not face any DMCA complaints since this song is licensed for osu!.
- The map is pre-timed, so it will save us the hassle of trying to time the song.

This manual is divided into lecture weeks so that you pace yourself and learn at a rate that you are comfortable. Each week, there will consist of mapping "homework", pre-lecture videos, and questions that are meant to making you think about mapping differently. The goal by the end of this guide, is that you will have created a simple beatmap whilst having learned the foundations of mapping so that you can branch out into other fields of mapping that you enjoy. Good luck fellow mapper!
